## Project Overview

This project utilizes the Spotify API to extract and analyze data on top Pop-Punk and Metalcore artists. The analysis was conducted using Databricks, enabling efficient data processing and visualization.

## Objectives

- Extract data on Pop-Punk and Metalcore artists from the Spotify API.
- Analyze the popularity metrics of these artists.
- Visualize the data to identify trends and insights.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Databricks**: For data processing and analysis.
- **Python**: Scripting language used for API interaction and data manipulation.
- **Spotify API**: Source of music data.

## Files

- `Top Pop-Punk & Metalcore Artists - Spotify API.py`: Python script for data extraction and analysis.
- `artists_ready.xlsx`: Processed data exported to Excel for further analysis.

## Usage

1. **Setup**: Ensure you have access to Databricks and the necessary permissions to run Python scripts.
2. **API Access**: Obtain Spotify API credentials and configure them in the script.
3. **Execution**: Run the Python script in Databricks to extract and analyze the data.
4. **Output**: Review the processed data in `artists_ready.xlsx` for insights.

## Results
